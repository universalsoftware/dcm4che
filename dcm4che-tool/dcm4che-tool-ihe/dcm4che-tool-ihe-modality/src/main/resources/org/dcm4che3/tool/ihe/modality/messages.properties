description=\n\
The modality application provides a configurable work-flow tool \
integrating Key Objects, MPPS, C-STORE, and Storage Commitment. \n\
The tool can:\n\
* Create a DICOM Key Object Selection Document (KOS) with specified Document Title \
-title <code> flagging DICOM Composite objects in specified <file>.. and \
<directory>.. and store it into DICOM file -o <file>.\n\
* Send a MPPS N-CREATE and MPPS N-SET message referencing the SOP Instances \
in the scanned files to a Service Class Provider (SCP) of the MPPS SOP \
Class.\n\
* Send a C-STORE message to a Storage Service Class Provider \
(SCP) for each DICOM file on the command line and wait for a response.\n\
* Send a Storage Commitment Requests (N-ACTION RQ) \
for the SOP Instances in the scanned files to a Service Class \
Provider (SCP) of the Storage Commitment Push Model SOP Class.\n\-\n\

Example: modality --stgcmt -b MODALITY:11114 -c DCM4CHEE@localhost:11112 path/to/study\n\
=> i) Start server listening on port 11114, accepting association requests with \
MODALITY as called AE title (for receiving Storage Commitment Results). \
ii) Scan images in directory  path/to/study and send a MPPS N-CREATE RQ and \
MPPS N-SET RQ referencing the images to DCM4CHEE, listening on local port 11112 \
(to send MPPS N-SET RQ after sending the DICOM objects use option --mpps-late). \
iii) Send DICOM objects to DCM4CHEE@localhost:11112. \
iv) Send a Storage Commitment Request for SOP Instances in directory path/to/study \
to DCM4CHEE@localhost:11112.
